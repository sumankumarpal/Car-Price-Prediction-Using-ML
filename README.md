# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-ML
As a result of incredible technological
advancements and research of new technical expertise and huge
economical growth of our country, people started to buy cars
more than other vehicles. Therefore, there arises an enormous
demand for cars, as the demand increases for new cars the used
car market also booms alike. But the used car market is highly
manipulated by few numbers of people who govern the rates of
the used cars and also online selling websites designate the
values for the used cars. This paper tries to study and investigate
the trends in used car prices and predicts the price of used cars
with the help of supervised machine learning algorithms. And
to suggest which machine learning algorithm performs well
among the selected methods for predicting the cars price. There
has been related work done with machine learning algorithms
like linear regression, multiple regression, random forest and so
on. We wanted to study which algorithm predicts the car price
more reliably and accurately. So that this solution will be helpful
for first time used car buyers and also for sellers for determining
the selling cost of the car
